# Dynamic Weather Visualization and Representation Tool


**Description:**
This project is a Python-based application that dynamically fetches and displays weather data for any specified city or the user's current location. It integrates text-based schematic weather representation with graphical visualization to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience. The project leverages the wttr.in service to retrieve real-time weather data and offers the following features:

Schematic Weather Representation: Displays detailed weather information in a text format, including temperature, wind speed, and conditions, enhanced with visual symbols.

Graphical Weather Visualization: Generates a line graph showing the highest temperatures for today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, making it easy to observe trends.

**Features:**

Detects the user's location automatically using their IP address or allows manual input of a city name.

Fetches detailed weather data in both schematic (text) and graphical formats.

Uses Python's requests library to fetch real-time weather data and Matplotlib for graphical plotting.

Provides robust error handling to ensure a seamless user experience.

**Technologies Used:**

Programming Language: Python

**Libraries:**

requests for HTTP requests and data fetching.

matplotlib for data visualization.

**Data Source:** wttr.in for real-time weather data (text and JSON formats).

**Use Cases:**

Quickly check the current weather and forecast for the next three days.

Analyze and visualize temperature trends for better decision-making.

Combine textual and graphical outputs for a detailed and user-friendly weather overview.
